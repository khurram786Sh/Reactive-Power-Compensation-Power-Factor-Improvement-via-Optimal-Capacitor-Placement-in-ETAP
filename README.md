## Introduction:
Reactive power compensation and power factor improvement are critical for efficient electrical systems. The project employs the Optimal Capacitor Placement (OCP) mode in ETAP to reduce reactive power, enhance power factor, and improve overall system performance by strategically placing capacitors in the network.

## Methodology:

### Procedure:
1. **One-Line Diagram**: First, create a one-line diagram of the electrical system using ETAP.
2. **Load Flow Analysis**: Perform load flow analysis and identify critical alerts in buses and cables.
3. **Remove Overloads**: Address overloads by increasing conductor size and cable capacity.
4. **Optimal Capacitor Placement**: Use OCP to identify optimal locations for capacitor placement, reducing power factor issues.
5. **Analysis**: Add capacitors as per the results and perform load flow analysis to ensure power factor improvements.

## Results and Discussion:
After running load flow analysis and addressing overloads, the power factor at the grid was found to be low. By using Optimal Capacitor Placement, we successfully improved the power factor and compensated for reactive power without resorting to expensive transformer tapping. The result was a more efficient and stable power system.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of Optimal Capacitor Placement in improving power factor and compensating for reactive power in electrical networks. The use of ETAP allowed for a detailed and efficient approach, providing significant system improvements at a lower cost compared to traditional methods.
